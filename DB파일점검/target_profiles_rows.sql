Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression (PubMed:12524540, PubMed:17189187). Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

Fc-binding subunit that associates with CD247 and/or FCER1G adapters to form functional signaling complexes. Following the engagement of antigen-IgG complexes, triggers phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adapters with subsequent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and sustained elevation of intracellular calcium that ultimately drive NK cell activation. The ITAM-dependent signaling coupled to receptor phosphorylation by PKC mediates robust intracellular calcium flux that leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas in the absence of receptor phosphorylation it mainly activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling leading to cell degranulation (PubMed:1825220, PubMed:23024279, PubMed:2532305). Costimulates NK cells and trigger lysis of target cells independently of IgG binding (PubMed:10318937, PubMed:23006327). Mediates the antitumor activities of therapeutic antibodies.
